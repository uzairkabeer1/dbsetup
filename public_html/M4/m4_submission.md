<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>In the init_db.php file, we have implemented a script that initializes and sets<br>up the database for our application. This script ensures that all the necessary<br>tables, relationships, and data structures are created and ready to be used.<br><br>The script<br>starts by establishing a connection to the database server. It then proceeds to<br>check if the required database already exists. If it doesn&#39;t exist, the script<br>creates a new database with the appropriate name and sets it up with<br>the necessary configurations.<br><br>Next, the script creates the required tables in the database. It<br>defines the table schemas, including the column names, data types, and any constraints<br>or indexes needed for optimal performance. These tables are essential for storing and<br>organizing the data used by our application.<br><br>Once the tables are created, the script<br>populates them with initial data. This includes inserting sample records or default values<br>to provide a starting point for our application&#39;s functionality. This data can be<br>modified or updated later as per the specific requirements of our application.<br><br>Finally, the<br>script performs some additional setup tasks, such as creating views or stored procedures,<br>that are crucial for our application&#39;s operations.<br></p>

Specifically, I learned how to use Git to manage<br>and track changes to my code. I learned how to create branches, make<br>commits, and merge changes back into the main branch. One concrete example of<br>this was when I was working on a new feature and accidentally introduced<br>a bug. Using Git, I was able to quickly revert my changes to<br>a previous version and fix the issue. Overall, learning about version control has<br>helped me become a more efficient and effective developer.</span><br></p><br></td></tr>
